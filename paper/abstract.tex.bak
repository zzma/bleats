\textbf{Classroom Attendance Tracking (CAT) is a well-established practice for
recording physical student presence, and is often used as a proxy measure of
student engagement or school accountability of students.  Yet despite the broad
utility and pervasiveness of CAT, it remains a tedious, manual, and error-prone
process, and there are surprisingly few modern technological solutions to
address these issues. In this work, we investigate a novel CAT application,
Bluetooth Low Energy Attendance Tracking System (BLEATS), that uses BLE beacon
technology to provide fast and easily deployable CAT. We further evaluate the
feasibility of BLEATS by focusing on authentication accuracy and communication
reliability at scale, via second-factor authencation and network simulation,
respectively. We find promising results that suggest that BLEATS performs well
under typical classroom scale, and hope our findings motivate future work
towards deploying BLEATS in real-world scenarios.}
