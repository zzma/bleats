\section{Conclusion} 

\label{sec:conclusion}

Bluetooth Low Energy is a burgeoning technology that is gaining widespread
adoption and being employed as a wireless communication protocol in many
applications due to its simplicity and low energy consumption. In our project,
we apply BLE to classroom attendance tracking, which is still a surprisingly
mundane, error-prone, and technologically-neglected process. We implement
BLEATS, a BLE passive beacon-based CAT solution and study its potential
viability in real classrooms. First, we implement a two factor SMTP
authentication protocol that enforces strict authentication accuracy. Second,
we simulate and measure the transmission range, device scale, and topology
properties of BLEATS. Our measurements yield promising upper-bounds of 200m
transmission range and reliable transmission exceeding 1000 devices for a
simplified two-dimensional classroom grid. These positive results will
hopefully propel future practical implementation of BLEATS in a real classroom
setting.
