Having demonstrated the potential viability of BLEATS from an authentication
and simulated classroom environment perspective, we would attempt a real-world
implementation to test our theoretical models. A practical BLEATS
implementation would consist of building a central attendance recording
application and a downloadable mobile application that would be configured on a
individualized basis to broadcast a beacon message that contains a uniquely
identifying ID for a full classroom of students.  

On the authentication front, we would observe student attempts to thwart the
system and update our design accordingly, potentially employing the use of
split key authentication. We would also refine the timeout mechanism to reduce
the false-negative rate while limiting potential timiing attacks.

On the measurement front, we would be interested in the same reliability
metrics and scenarios that we simulated in order to better understand the
characteristics of real-world interference, for environments ranging from a
small classroom setting to a large lecture hall.  Additionally, we would be
interested in performing energy and transmission power measurements to optimize
the transmission range versus energy consumption tradeoff.
